Summary

Description:

I've discovered that the onMarkerClick callback function is not triggering when markers are clicked in AppleMaps.View component from the expo-maps package (alpha version). I know it is an alpha version packaged but I've been exploring using it for a new app.

Expected Behavior:

When clicking on a marker on the map, the onMarkerClick callback should be triggered, executing the provided function.

Actual Behavior:

Marker clicks do not trigger the onMarkerClick callback. No console logs appear and no functions execute when markers are tapped.

Reproduction Steps:

Create a React Native project with Expo
Install expo-maps: npx expo install expo-maps
Set up an AppleMaps.View with markers and an onMarkerClick handler
Run the app and try to click on markersâœ±**
Since expo-maps is in alpha, I understand there may be bugs like this. Any guidance on potential workarounds or expected timeline for a fix would be appreciated.
